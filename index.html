        <p>you need to understand that the school blocks websites and other resources on the network level. In order to acess websites and other stuff without restriction, you will need some way of bypassing school network restrictions. For now, just use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.windscribe.vpn&hl=en_US&gl=US">this</a> and set it to 'stealth' (upper lefthand hamburger menu > connection > connection mode > manual > protocol > stealth). My server is in the works.</p>

        <h>Accounts</h>
        <p>If one of your teachers use GoGuardian, you can switch to your school account by clicking on the bottom right menu > sign out > add another user. You can switch back to your other account by signing out.</p>

        <h>Testing</h>
        <p>On testing days where you need acess to the "signin apps," bring your real chromebook or borrow a spare from the teacher.</p>
